    "\n",
    "Welcome to CIS 545 Homework 5! \n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, we will learn more about the 'new electricity' - Deep Learning (I didn't coin this, Andrew Ng did) ! There are many cool frameworks for building deep learning models - PyTorch, Tensorflow, Theano, MxNet. Since you will be working with Big Data in this course, you need a framework that scales well. Almost all of these have a multi-gpu support built in. In this assignment, we will be building neural networks in PyTorch to solve an interesting problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning or neural network architectures have been used to solve a multitude of problems in various different fields like vision, natural language processing. So let's take a 'deep' dive into it.\n",

    "\n",
    "Deep learning has applications across numerous industries, which is why experts think that this technology is the future of almost everything. There are truly deep learning technologies such as Google’s very human-like talking AI, a new theory that cracks the 'black box' of deep learning, and various budding ideas like this one about why human forgetting might be the key to AI. Here are some cool applications of deep learning - \n",

    "##2.3 \"Convoluted\" Convolutional Neural Networks (Total: 29 points)\n",
    "So, what are CNNs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional Neural Networks are very similar to Feedforward Neural Networks from the previous section: they are made up of neurons that have learnable weights and biases. Each neuron receives some inputs, performs a dot product and optionally follows it with a non-linearity. The whole network still expresses a single differentiable score function: from the raw image pixels on one end to class scores at the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what changes? ConvNet architectures make the explicit assumption that the inputs are images, which allows us to encode certain properties into the architecture. These then make the forward function more efficient to implement and vastly reduce the amount of parameters in the network.\n",
